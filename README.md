# Technical Assessment for Breakawai
### (Breakawai) Data Scientist Trainee - Technical Assessment
⚠ Made with Python 3.10 and SQLite3 ⚠


## Set Objectives
- Create an ETL script to prepare a dataset for analysis:
  - Join the 3 Procure-to-Pay CSV files into one dataset, ensuring the validity and quality of the data; (🚩) \<\>
  - Add 2 new attributes to the dataset based on the Start Timestamp; (🚩) \<\>
  - Add an extra attribute of the World Continent based on the country given. (🚩) \<\>
  - Add a new dataset attribute to cluster the activities in phases, merging the dataset with the file "Phases_of_activities.csv" (🚩) \<\>

- Create a Machine Learning script for adding value based on the existing transformed dataset:
  - Create an extra column in the dataset that clusters the data based multiple "unseen" patterns; (🚩) \<\>
  - Explain the process and the decisions behind the machine learning techniques used to create this new column; (🚩) \<\>
  - Present some visualization of the graphical clusters; (🚩) \<\>

- Deadline \<2025-01-15\>
